                            <li>1.	LA in schools: a commitment to increasing and improving the provision of language analysis in schools both by enhancing the quality of aspects included in the current curriculum and by attempting to influence curriculum change, where appropriate. Crucially, the scope of this is not restricted to English and modern/classical languages but extends to other subjects including STEM.</li> 
                            <li>2.	LA in universities: a similar commitment to promoting language analysis in undergraduate courses that prepare the next generation of school teachers. The immediate challenge lies in English and foreign languages, but eventually language analysis should be encouraged in STEM and other subjects as well.</li>
                            <li>3.	National networks: a bridge between academics, secondary schools  and other organisations such as NCELP (and ALL and NATE), which organises national networking events to disseminate good practice in the use of language analysis in schools.</li>
                            <li>4.	Local hubs: a concrete proposal to explore (perhaps via LAGB and BAAL) the setting up of regional hubs to promote language analysis in schools. The idea is that academics in a given region would work with local teachers to co-produce and test materials and to organise CPD training and other events for a range of secondary school subjects. </li>
                            <li>5.	National repository: a central repository in which to store and share all successful materials, once tested, and via which to link to other useful materials for language analysis in relation to English, MFL and other secondary school subjects.</li>
